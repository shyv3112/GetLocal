# SMART NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES: A REAL-TIME LOCATION-BASED PLATFORM FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE BOOKING

Fast access to trustworthy professional services in one's area continues to be a 
significant difficulty in the age of digital revolution. Manual searches and word-of mouth are examples of traditional methods that are slow, ineffective, and frequently unreliable. To achieve 
this, we have offered a solution that enables direct booking, a live review system, emergency service provision, and calendar-based scheduling by integrating 
Firestore, Google Maps API, and contemporary UI frameworks like Next JS and Tailwind CSS. Our solution seeks to provide a strong 
administration gateway for providers and a safe, smart, and effective service booking 
experience for users.
